    <p1>This mac and cheese recipe with a buttered bread crumb topping is creamy and comforting.

        This results in a rich, decadent sauce that coats every nook and cranny of the noodles.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Macaroni and Cheese</h3>
        <li>8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>1/4 cup salted butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 Â½ cups milk, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>8 (6 inch) corn tortillas</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste (Optional)</li>
        
        <h3>Bread Crumb Topping</h3>
        <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry tablespoons salted butter</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground paprika</li>
    </ul>

    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking in the oven. 
            Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.</li>
        
        <li>While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat. 
            Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        
        <li>Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer. 
            Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper. 
            Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more milk if needed. 
            Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.</li>

        <li>Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. 
            Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and browned. 
            Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.</li>
        
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
        
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
