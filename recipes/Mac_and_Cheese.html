    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p1>This mac and cheese recipe with a buttered bread crumb topping is creamy and comforting. 
        It's easy to make the cheese sauce from scratch on your stovetop, starting with a roux and adding milk, Cheddar, and Parmesan. 
        This results in a rich, decadent sauce that coats every nook and cranny of the noodles. 
        Serve this comfort-food macaroni and cheese casserole with grilled meats, sloppy Joes, fried chicken or alongside a salad for a meatless dinner.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Macaroni and Cheese</h3>
        <li>8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>1/4 cup salted butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 Â½ cups milk, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>8 (6 inch) corn tortillas</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste (Optional)</li>
        
        <h3>Bread Crumb Topping</h3>
        <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry tablespoons salted butter</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground paprika</li>
    </ul>

    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove sausage to a plate. 
            Drain and discard grease; wipe the skillet clean with a paper towel.</li>
        
        <li>Place the same skillet over medium heat and grease with cooking spray. Whisk together eggs, milk, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; pour into the prepared skillet. 
            Cook and gently stir until scrambled and almost dry. Add sausage; continue to cook and stir until firm.</li>
        
        <li>Meanwhile, warm a second skillet over high heat. Cook tortillas until hot and crispy on the edges, but still pliable, about 45 seconds per side.</li>

        <li>Sprinkle Monterey Jack cheese evenly onto hot tortillas. Top each with scrambled eggs, salsa, and hot pepper sauce.</li>
        
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
